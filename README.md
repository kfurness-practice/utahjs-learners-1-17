##React with Stateless Functional Components

This project is the first part of presentation on using stateless functional components to build React apps.  I like using these sorts of components because I find it easier to reason about how they work and I'd like to demonstrate why.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Changed package.json:
"test": ["react-scripts test --env=jsdo","jest"],
to
"test": "jest",
